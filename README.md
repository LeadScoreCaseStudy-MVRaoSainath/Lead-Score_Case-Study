# Lead Score_Case Study
Problem Statement:

Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, a company that provides education. Several experts who are interested in the courses visit their website on any given day and search for courses.

On numerous websites and search engines like Google, the firm advertises its courses. When arriving at the website, these visitors may browse the courses, submit a form for the course, or watch some videos. These persons are categorized as leads when they fill out a form with their phone number or email address. Also, the business receives leads from earlier recommendations. Once these leads are obtained, sales team members begin calling, sending emails, etc. Some leads are converted during this procedure, but most are not. At X Education, the normal lead conversion rate is roughly 30%.

In the beginning, a lot of leads are generated, but very few of them end up becoming paying clients. To increase lead conversion, you must properly nurture the potential leads during the middle stage (e.g., by educating the leads about the product and maintaining ongoing communication).
You have been asked by X Education to assist them in choosing the leads that have the best chance of becoming paying clients. The business wants you to create a model in which you give each lead a lead score so that leads with higher lead scores have a better chance of converting, while leads with lower lead scores have a lesser chance of converting. The desired lead conversion rate has been estimated by the CEO to be in the range of 80%.

Goals and Objectives:

This case study has a lot of objectives.

Create a logistic regression model to provide each lead with a lead score between 0 and 100 that the business may use to target potential prospects. In contrast, a lower number would indicate that the lead is chilly and unlikely to convert, while a higher score would indicate that the lead is hot and most likely to convert..
